# PuzzleBox
Hello all, I am currently in the process of building a puzzle box for a little project. The puzzle consists of 3 simple taskes, one of which is having two photoresistors reacting to light to illuminate LEDs. These have to be at two different points and I have written this code that should detect the change of light and depending on the minus values within the code. After testing in tinkercad the LEDs don't change state when the photo resistor values are changed. 

Any help would be amazing.
